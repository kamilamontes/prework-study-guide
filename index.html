        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the contentinside an element</li>
          <li>inline CSS (Inline styles), apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for a webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>A selector (div) defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue</li>
          <li>the h1 and h2 rule assignment is a positioning property, text-align one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>The CSS rule for the ul elements declares the font, and the padding on the left of the unordered list</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>

          <li>Git add -A: commands add modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. the -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs git that the changes will be added in the next commit </li>
          <li>Git pull origin main: identify a git command with the git keyword. the pull command to receives a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the github repo. The main keyword indicates the branch</li>
